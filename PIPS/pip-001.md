What is an PIP?
--------------

PIP stands for Parsec Improvement Proposal. An PIP is a design document providing information to the Parsec community, or describing a new feature for Parsec or its processes or environment. The PIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The PIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

PIP Rational
------------

We intend PIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Parsec. Because the PIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

History
-------

This document was derived heavily from [Ethereum's EIP-1] written by Martin Becze and Hudson Jameson which in turn was derived from [Bitcoin's BIP-0001]. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Authors of the EIP-1 should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Parsec or the PIP. Please direct all comments to the PIP editors.

October 18, 2017: PIP 1 has been created.
