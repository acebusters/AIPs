## Simple Summary
The Parsec Basic Income Program pays out TITs (Taco Income Token) weekly to contributing members of the Parsec community.

## Motivation
We want to incentivise participation and communication in the [Parsec Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/acebusters/shared_invite/enQtNDA2NDE4MjE0NzQzLTVhYzIzOTcyMThjNWEzNjlhMzlkMjU4ZGZlZjg3OTAwNDQ1OWJjMWI2ZTU5ZWQ3OGRmNTQ0M2IyN2VlYTg0ZWY).

## Specification

Each slack member can give up to 5 ðŸŒ® per day to other members. This scheme is used to reward effort and contribution to the project. By the end of the week, a member can claim basic income by exchanging fresh ðŸŒ® (earned same week) for TITs.

*Claim of Income:*

To claim the income, members can submit a claim through [the TITs Claim Sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPyotEu_tvSH5DY3tD6Q130OixWRDrStrX_YoKG4viDApE9w/viewform).

Claims can be made with following taco amounts:
- 4 ðŸŒ® give 4 TITs
- 5 ðŸŒ® give 5 TITs
- 6 ðŸŒ® give 6 TITs
- 7 ðŸŒ® give 7 TITs
- 8+ ðŸŒ® give 8 TITs

Claims have to be submitted until 23:00 UTC Monday for the previous week. Proofs will be verified until 13:00 UTC Thursday for the same week. No more than the first 8 ðŸŒ® can be exchanged in a week. ðŸŒ® from previous weeks can NOT be carried over. The [heytaco leadership board](https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard?timeframe=lastweek) is used as a source of truth for taco counts.
