## Simple Summary
The Parsec Basic Income Program pays out Parsec tokens weekly to contributing members of the Parsec community.

## Motivation
We want to incentivise participation and communication in the Parsec slack channel. 20,000,000 Parsec tokens (5% of total supply) are allocated to this program.

## Specification

Each slack member can give up to 5 tacos per day to other members. This scheme is used to reward effort and contribution to the project. By the end of the week, a member can claim basic income by exchanging fresh tacos (earned same week) for Parsec tokens.

*Claim of Income:*

To claim the income, members can submit a claim through [the claim form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPyotEu_tvSH5DY3tD6Q130OixWRDrStrX_YoKG4viDApE9w/viewform).

Claims can be made with following taco amounts:
- 8 tacos (half income - Parsec tokens 60,000)
- 16 tacos (full income - Parsec tokens 120,000)

Claims have to be submitted until 13:00 UTC Monday for the previous week. Proofs will be verified until 13:00 UTC Thursday for the same week. No more than the first 16 tacos can be exchanged in a week. Tacos from previous weeks can not be carried over. The [heytaco leadership board](https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard?timeframe=lastweek) is used as a sounce of truth for taco counts.
