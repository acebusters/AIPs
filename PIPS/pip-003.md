## Simple Summary
The Parsec Basic Income Program pays out Parsec tokens (PSC) weekly to contributing members of the Parsec community.

## Motivation
We want to incentivise participation and communication in the Parsec slack channel. 20,000,000 PSC (5% of total supply) are allocated to this program.

## Specification

Each slack member can give up to 5 ðŸŒ® per day to other members. This scheme is used to reward effort and contribution to the project. By the end of the week, a member can claim basic income by exchanging fresh ðŸŒ® (earned same week) for PSC.

*Claim of Income:*

To claim the income, members can submit a claim through [the reward store](https://www.heytaco.chat/rewards).

Claims can be made with following taco amounts:
- 4 ðŸŒ® give 30,000 PSC
- 8 ðŸŒ® give 60,000 PSC
- 12 ðŸŒ® give 90,000 PSC
- 16 ðŸŒ® give 120,000 PSC

Claims have to be submitted until 13:00 UTC Monday for the previous week. Proofs will be verified until 13:00 UTC Thursday for the same week. No more than the first 16 ðŸŒ® can be exchanged in a week. ðŸŒ® from previous weeks can NOT be carried over. The [heytaco leadership board](https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard?timeframe=lastweek) is used as a sounce of truth for taco counts.
