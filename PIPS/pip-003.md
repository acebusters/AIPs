## Simple Summary
The Parsec Basic Income Program pays out Parsec tokens (PSC) weekly to contributing members of the Parsec community.

## Motivation
We want to incentivise participation and communication in the Parsec slack channel. 10,000,000 PSC (12.5% of all premined tokens) are allocated to this program.

## Specification

Each slack member can give up to 5 🌮 per day to other members. This scheme is used to reward effort and contribution to the project. By the end of the week, a member can claim basic income by exchanging fresh 🌮 (earned same week) for PSC.

*Claim of Income:*

To claim the income, members can submit a claim through [the TITs Claim Sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPyotEu_tvSH5DY3tD6Q130OixWRDrStrX_YoKG4viDApE9w/viewform).

Claims can be made with following taco amounts:
- 4 🌮 give 4 NFT
- 5 🌮 give 5 NFT
- 6 🌮 give 6 NFT
- 7 🌮 give 7 NFT
- 8+ 🌮 give 8 NFT

Claims have to be submitted until 13:00 UTC Monday for the previous week. Proofs will be verified until 13:00 UTC Thursday for the same week. No more than the first 16 🌮 can be exchanged in a week. 🌮 from previous weeks can NOT be carried over. The [heytaco leadership board](https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard?timeframe=lastweek) is used as a sounce of truth for taco counts.

## Exchanging NFT to PSC or DAI

*Initial setup*

(optional) Add Faucet contract as Custom token at https://wallet.ethereum.org/contracts. Use “PSC to claim” name or similar as it will show the amount of PSC available for claim.

*Claiming PSC or DAI*
