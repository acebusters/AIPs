## Simple Summary

The Bounty Budget is an allowance for a circle to write out rewards to complete required tasks. Completed tasks are payed by the Escrow council to the claiming member.

## Motivation
Extend the Basic Income program with goal-oriented incentives.

## Specification

Each circle that chooses PIP005 to manage its goals will be able to register Bounties up to a certain limit. The total number of bounties registered per circle should at no time exceed 40,000 DAI. Also no more than 14,000 DAI of bounties can be claimed per month.

### Who can register bounties, and how?

The lead links of the 3 circles can register bounties. It is done in the following steps:
1. Create a bounty description in [this wiki](https://github.com/parsec-labs/PIPs/wiki/Bounties)
2. The bounty definition should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound)
3. Create a poll in the #escrow-council channel with a link to the bounty description
4. Members of #escrow-council verify that bounty does not exceed the budget and assign a Verifier.
5. Verifier has to be lead link of other circle.
6. Have 4 signing members of #escrow-council vote and 3 agree that bounty is SMART.
7. Update the Bounty state to approved in the wiki.
