## Simple Summary

The Bounty Budget is an allowance for a circle to write out rewards to complete required tasks. Completed tasks are payed by the Escrow council to the claiming member.

## Motivation
Extend the Basic Income program with goal-oriented incentives.

## Specification

Each circle that chooses PIP005 to manage its goals will be able to register Bounties up to a certain limit. The total number of bounties registered per circle should at no time exceed 40,000 DAI. Also no more than 14,000 DAI of bounties can be claimed per month.

### Who can register bounties, and how?

The Lead Links of the 3 circles can register bounties. It is done in the following steps:
1. Create an issue with bounty description and `bounty` tag in an appropriate repository. If it is not clear which repository to use, create an bounty issue in [PARSEC General repo](https://github.com/parsec-labs/parsec-general-circle/). [[Template](#bounty-template)] [[Example](https://github.com/parsec-labs/parsec-general-circle/issues/35)]
   - If the bounty spans across multiple repositories, consider splitting it in a smaller per-repo bounties if possible
   - The bounty definition should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound)

2. Add the bounty to the [Bounties](https://github.com/parsec-labs/PIPs/wiki/Bounties) page with a `Draft` status.

3. Decide on bounty amount and verifier and create a "Yes/No" poll in the `#escrow-council` channel with a link to the bounty description to vote on the bounty eligibility, reward size and verifier.
   -  By voting members of `#escrow-council` verify that bounty does not exceed the budget and is SMART.

4. Bounty is approved once it have votes of 4 signing members of #escrow-council.
5. Update the Bounty state to `Approved` in the [wiki](https://github.com/parsec-labs/PIPs/wiki/Bounties).
