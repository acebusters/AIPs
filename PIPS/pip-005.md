## Simple Summary

The Bounty Budget is an allowance for each circle to write out rewards to complete required tasks. Completed tasks are payed by the Escrow council to the claiming member.

## Motivation
Extend the Basic Income program with goal-oriented incentives.

## Specification

The 3 circles (Communications, Acebusters Dapp, R&D) each receive a budget which can be used to register Bounties. The total number of bounties registered per circle should at no time exceed 10,000 DAI. Also no more than 7,000 USD of bounties can be claimed per month.

### Who can register bounties, and how?

The lead links of the 3 circles can register bounties. It is done in the following steps:
- Create a poll in the #escrow-council channel with a link to the bounty description
- The bounty definition should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound)
- Members of #escrow-council verify that bounty does not exceed the budget.
- Have 4 signing members of #escrow-council vote and 3 agree that bounty is SMART.
- Add bounty to list of registered bounties (github link?)


### Who can claim the bounty?

Any-one can claim the bounty by completing the task in the description. It is done in the following steps:
- Submit a Bounty Claim Request to #escrow-council
- Bounty completion is reviewed by Proposer and by a lead-link of one other circle.
- The bounty amount (denominated in USD) is payed out in ETH at the current rate.
