## Simple Summary

The Escrow Council runs a buy back program for parners (members that hold a role in the Parsec circle or sub circles) to be able to convert some of the earned Parsec tokens to Ether, as long as the Parsec token is not registered for trading.

## Specification

The council buys back up to 2/3 of Parsec tokens that have been received by partners as basic income in the same week under PIP003 at a price of 100 PSC = 1 USD. The council pays in ETH at market rate determined at 12 UTC on Monday of that week.

*Example:*
- half income: 8 tacos - 60,000 Parsec tokens - buys back up to 40,000 Parsec with 400 USD in ETH
- full income: 16 tacos - 120,000 Parsec tokens - buys back up to 80,000 Parsec with 800 USD in ETH
