## Simple Summary

The Escrow Council runs a buy back program for parners (members that hold a role in the Parsec circle or sub circles) to be able to convert some of the earned Parsec tokens (PSC) to Ether, as long as the Parsec token is not registered for trading.

## Specification

The council buys back up to 2/3 of PSC that have been received by partners as basic income in the same week under PIP003 at a price of 100 PSC = 1 DAI. The council pays in ETH at market rate determined at 12 UTC on Monday of that week.

*Example:*
- 4 ðŸŒ® give 30,000 PSC, of which up to 20,000 PSC are bought back for 200 DAI in ETH
- 8 ðŸŒ® give 60,000 PSC, of which up to 40,000 PSC are bought back for 400 DAI in ETH
- 12 ðŸŒ® give 90,000 PSC, of which up to 60,000 PSC are bought back for 600 DAI in ETH
- 16 ðŸŒ® give 120,000 PSC, of which up to 80,000 PSC are bought back for 800 DAI in ETH
