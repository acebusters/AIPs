## Simple Summary

The Escrow Council runs a buy back program for parners (members that hold a role in the Parsec circle or sub circles).

The council buys back up to 80,000 Parsec tokens that have been received by partners as basic income in the same week under PIP003 at a price of 100 PSC = 1 USD. The council pays in ETH at market rate determined at 12 UTC on Monday of that week.
