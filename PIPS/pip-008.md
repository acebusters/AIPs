    Affects: PIP004, PIP005, PIP007


## Simple Summary
When we short on funds, cut our costs to bare minimum. Reduce basic income buyback and keep budgets only for funds-attracting activities.
This PIP is basically a set of amendments to PIP004, PIP005, PIP007.

## Motivation
When we are running out of cash, our top priority should be to look for more money to sustain the project. Building positive cashflow, looking for new investments and/or grants. We cut our expenses to give us more time for that and to postpone the bankruptcy.

This PIP applies the next Monday 00:00 UTC after Escrow council balance becomes less than 50,000 DAI worth of ETH.
