## Simple Summary
The Acebusters Basic Income program pays a basic income of 1000 USD to 2000 USD to members of the Acebusters community.

## Motivation
Currently we can not pay competitive salaries, but we want to pay enough, so active community members don't have to work on the side or spend their time otherwise to create cashflow.


## Specification

*Proof of community:*

A proof of community can be either one of:
- receiving a taco in a public slack channel
- referring a friend to do a signup and a first game

Tacos and referrals have to be fresh, created in the same week.

*Claim of income:*

To claim the weekly income of USD 250 to USD 500, people can submit a claim through this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPyotEu_tvSH5DY3tD6Q130OixWRDrStrX_YoKG4viDApE9w/viewform

Claims can be made with combos of the follwing proofs:
- 10 tacos (USD 250)
- active Menteeship (USD 250)
- 10 tacos and 5 refs (USD 500)
- 10 refs			  (USD 500)
- 20 tacos (only scrum master, USD 500)
- active Menteeship and 5 refs (USD 500)


Proofs have to be submitted until 13:00 UTC Monday for the previous week. Proofs will be verified until 13:00 UTC Thursday for the same week.

*Mentorship:*
Each member of the community can become a mentor, if at least 10 incomes have been claimed. A mentor can only have one mentee at a time, and each mentorship takes exactly 4 weeks. During the mentorship the mentee can claim incomes based on the mentorship.

Once a mentee exits a mentorship, and is able to claim 6 additional incomes, the mentor receives a reward of 3 ETH.

## Rationale
- We want a transparent and equal-for-everyone process with little overhead, that can easily be extended to new members.
- We want to incentivize teamwork and player on-boarding.
