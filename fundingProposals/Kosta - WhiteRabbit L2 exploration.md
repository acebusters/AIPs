# 2-week WhiteRabbit optimistic L2 exploration

## Purpose

Explore and try out OVM Rollup as a blockchain solution for the WhiteRabbit project

## Retrospective and motivation

Ongoing WhiteRabbit project needs a chain to run at. WR operates on low-value, high-volume transactions
and currently runs on xDai chain. Using xDai is a temporary solution as it is a Proof-of-Authority network and thus
requires an extra degree of trust.

Motivation for the proposed project is three-fold:
- start migration of WhiteRabbit on more suitable platform
- learn and get hands-on experience with one more L2 solution (in addition to Plasma chain and Nutberry rollup)
- possibly useful expertise for StatusPay project

This also answers "Why is your proposal relevant for us?" question.

## Team
Kosta — all hands

## Project duration

1 Sept — 16 Sept

## Fund Allocation

Requesting 3500 DAI. 

Funds allocation:
- 2400 DAI — cover Kosta's work 1.09 — 16.09
- 1100 DAI - reserve to cover the work of other people should they contribute to the project

Reserve will be returned if unused.
2000 DAI Kosta's allocation will be returned if unused (simple majority vote of LeapDAO's top-5 reputation holders)

## Rough roadMap

- explore the OVM codebase and docs
- set up a single node chain with contracts on some testnet (ropsten?)
- try out a sample contract execution
- deploy WR's CollectionPool or alike to the chain

This is a rough roadmap and can change along the way. Not all the things may be achieved in a requested timeframe. 
Team is committed to do their best effort in achieving the project.
