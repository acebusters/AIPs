## Intro

LeapDAO is an adaptive organization broken down into a semi-autonomous Circles, a groups of people around a shared purpose and multisig wallet. Dev Circle is the one of these Circles and is focusing on delivering software to scale Ethereum Dapps without compromising on security. "To scale" here means faster and less expensive Dapps execution.

The current Dev Circle's strategy to achieve that is to develop, launch and foster a general purpose Plasma chain (Leap Network). From the many flavours of Plasma frameworks, we chose More Viable Plasma and Plasma Leap. More Viable Plasma (MVP) design covers simple transfer transactions on plasma chain, while Plasma Leap extension allows off-chain smart contract execution secured by a special challenge game on the root chain.

Dev Circle is also interested in adapting a Rollup approach for running a L2 chain instead of Plasma. Both approaches have their own merits.

## Current focus

* Plasma Leap development (integration with SolEVM, watchtowers)
* Improvements to increase adoption of Plasma Leap (spending conditions model)
* Creating better environment for Dev Circle developers

Software produced by the circle is currently used by Ops Circle to run the networks (testnet/mainnet). Thus pursuing it's purpose, Ops Circle may request changes to be done in the software.

Software produced by the circle is used Ecosystem Circle to connect to Leap Network. Thus pursuing it's purpose, Ecosystem Circle may request changes to be done in the software.

## Roadmap

## What to work on

* 🌴 any non-assigned bounty tagged with `Status: Available` from the [Roadmap](#Roadmap) (click on the item to see the list). Those closer to the beggining of the list are better
* 🐞 Something from the [list](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3Aleapdao+label%3A%22Status%3A+Available%22). These will be paid on hourly basis and of second priority.
* ⭐️ anything else you see as aligned with the Dev Circle purpose and focus but not reported on Github. Ask on Slack first.
