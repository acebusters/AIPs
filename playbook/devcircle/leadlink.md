## Accountabilities

### Updating roadmap and groom issue list

Domain: [Roadmap](https://github.com/leapdao/meta/blob/master/playbook/devcircle/index.md)

- triage **new issues** in dev circle github repos:
  - set `Type:*` labels
  - if the issue is aligned with current roadmap and focus mark it with `Status: Available`
- review new Dev Circle bounty proposals. Set as `Status: Available` when all the conditions met:
  - bounty is well-defined
  - bounty is aligned with Dev Circle purpose
  - bounty passed 2 days objection period with no objections
  - gardener is aware of this process but sloppy
- update statuses of roadmap projects (not-started, in progress, done)
- review roadmap project boards
  - work in progress issues should be set as `Status: In Progress` (_TODO: automate_)
  - work in progress issues should have assignee (_TODO: automate_)
- review list of `Status: Available` things. If anything is not making sense anymore in the light of current focus, remove the label.
