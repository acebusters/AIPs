# Bounty definition

This policy allows to write out rewards to complete required tasks. Completed tasks are payed by the Escrow council to the claiming member.

How to create a new bounty?
Create an issue with bounty description and a bounty tag in an appropriate repository.
If the bounty spans across multiple repositories, consider splitting it in a smaller per-repo bounties if possible.
If the bounty is larger than M, then the best known expert in the bounty matter should be consulted and included in an "Expert" field in the bounty description.
Submit proposal via the bounty form: http://bounty.leapdao.org/viewform
Add the bounty to the bounties board: https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/6

Objections:
Any bounty can be objected by anyone through Slack or GitHub for 2 days after its creation.
The objector must ensure that their objection is clearly communicated to the bounty proposer and e.g. not misunderstood as a minor comment on the issue.
In the cases where objector and proposer are not able to come to an acceptable solution, the circle’s facilitator must be involved to enact Holacracy constitution’s article “3.3.5 INTEGRATIVE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS” to solve the objection as a tension.
If the tension was integrated successfully or if there weren’t any public objections, the bounty is considered approved.
Bounty sizes
XS	200
S	350
M	550
L	900
XL	1400

Pair programming
If 2 people work on the bounty together, the payout increases by 1.5x.

Bounty Challenge
If bounty has no progress for 4 days, then anyone can challenge the bounty. Once the bounty is challenged, the worker has 3 more days to deliver some progress on the bounty (gardener can make exception and extend period to 5 days 1x, unless gardener is also working). If worker fails to make progress within period, the bounty is up for grabs by anyone.
