# Template - Project Funding Proposal
Here is our first template/guideline to create a **Project Funding Proposal**.
Funds within LeapDAO are limited, most are connected to specific projects & their deliverables.

Please check the accepted examples & check our template below, answer the questions for each section & include as much information as you like.

Within the Conclusion, please make sure to tell us why your project is a must-fund for LeapDAO and what our DAO will gain through your work.

You can also reach out to the **[Meta-Crew](https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/14849/orgnav/roles/12809527/overview)**, these guys can check your proposal & provide ideas to find a structure & improve it.
