## Simple Summary
This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for all those who participate in the community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Motivation
A primary goal of user groups that refer to this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

We invite all those who participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between actions and their effects on the community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

### Expected Behavior
- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert the community link if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in the community online and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community link may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event). The community link can request a permanent expulsion of a member by raising a tension in the tactical or governance meeting of the general circle.

### If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the community link as soon as possible. 

### Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the community link, secretary or facilitator of the general circle with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

### Scope
All community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; and other guests) are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
