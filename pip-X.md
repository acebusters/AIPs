This is the suggested template for new PIPs.

Note that an PIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your PIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `pip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

## Preamble

    PIP: <to be assigned>
    Title: <PIP title>
    Author: <list of authors' names and optionally, email addresses>
    Status: Draft
    Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
    Requires (*optional): <PIP number(s)>
    Replaces (*optional): <PIP number(s)>


## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the PIP.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for PIPs that want to change the Parsec/Acebusters protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PIP solves. PIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow implementation.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Backwards Compatibility
All PIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The PIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. PIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.


## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any PIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the PIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
