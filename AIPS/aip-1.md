What is an AIP?
--------------

AIP stands for Acebusters Improvement Proposal. An AIP is a design document providing information to the Acebusters community, or describing a new feature for Acebusters or its processes or environment. The AIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The AIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

AIP Rational
------------

We intend AIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Acebusters. Because the AIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

History
-------

This document was derived heavily from [Ethereum's EIP-1] written by Martin Becze and Hudson Jameson which in turn was derived from [Bitcoin's BIP-0001]. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Authors of the EIP-1 should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Acebusters or the AIP. Please direct all comments to the AIP editors.

October 18, 2017: AIP 1 has been created.
